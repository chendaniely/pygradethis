Hello :wave: :

Thanks for testing out this package. We really do appreciate the community exploring the new tools we're working on.

However, this package is currently in such an early stage of development that nothing is really expected to work right now.
The other problem is anything discussion we'd have around these bug reports may be immediately outdated as we try to integrate them with other tools.

Please check back when we have a more official public release later this year.
