# pygradethis

A Python package to facilitate checking code output or static code checking
using AST analysis. It can either be used with R using the `learnr` package, as 
a mirror of `gradethis` package, or as a standalone package for general Python 
use in educational settings.

**Note**: This package is in early development and will undergo rapid changes.
